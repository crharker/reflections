When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If working across multiple devices or with multiple people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because if you are in the middle of a change yourself, this may get you 
    out of sync.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

   A fork is when you make a clone of a git repo on GitHub, a clone is when you
   make a copy of a repo locally. A branch is when you split the commits into
   different threads, which you could later merge.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    So you can merge them and remove and conflicts. You can see the changes that
    other people have done. You have access to those when you are offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Have a shared location with the source code, not needing to remember the git 
    commands would be easier. It would be harder to track changes and it limits
    how many people can be working at it at the same time.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When working on new features so it doesn't impact the production master branch
    This allows you to work on adding new features which doesn't imapct the master
    branch until you are ready. Meanwhile bugs and stuff can be updated in the master
    branch
